Control how your content is viewed when shared on social media.

== Description ==

Open Graphite lets you control how your WordPress content is viewed when shared on social media.

Typically when one of your pages is shared on social media (Facebook for example), the platform will use the first image and text it can find on the page. This is usually not ideal and often truncates the content into something nonsensical, resulting in the page being less likely to be engaged with.

Open Graphite solves this problem, by allowing you to customise the image, title and description of any of your pages that are shared on social media, all without compromising the original content.

== Installation ==

1) Go to 'Add New' plugins in WordPress admin
2) Search for 'Open Graphite'
3) Click 'Install Now' and wait for it to finish installing
4) Click 'Activate'

== How to use ==

For the homepage...

* Go to Open Graphite (admin side menu)
* Set your homepage title, description, image and object type
